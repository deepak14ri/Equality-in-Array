# Equality-in-Array
Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to delete to leave only elements of equal value.  Example arr= [1,2,2,3]  Delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr as [2,2]. If both twos plus either the 1 or the 3 are deleted, it takes 3 deletions to leave either [3] or [1]. The minimum number of deletions is . 2  Input Format The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in arr. The next line contains n space-separated integers arr[i].  Constraints 0&lt;n&lt;=100 1&lt;=arr[i]&lt;=100 Sample Input 5 3 3 2 1 3
Equality in Array
Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to delete to leave only elements of equal value.

Example
arr= [1,2,2,3]

Delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr as [2,2]. If both twos plus either the 1 or the 3 are deleted, it takes 3 deletions to leave either [3] or [1]. The minimum number of deletions is . 2

Input Format
The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in arr. The next line contains n space-separated integers arr[i].

Constraints
0<n<=100
1<=arr[i]<=100
Sample Input
5
3 3 2 1 3
Sample Output
2

Explanation
Delete 2 and 1 to leave [3,3,3]. This is minimal. The only other options are to delete 4 elements to get an array of either [1] or [2].
